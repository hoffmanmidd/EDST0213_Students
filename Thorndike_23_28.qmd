## Quarto

*From the documentation about this method of producing documents and slide decks using R and RStudio:* This is a Quarto presentation (the replacement/enhancement of RMarkdown).

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
1 + 1
```

## Prerequsites

Since we will be following the instructions in *R for Data Science* (RDS) we will install package called tidyverse. To access this package for the first time on your computer, paste or type into in your console

install.packages("tidyverse")

# Inputing, Tidying and Wrangling Thorndike pp. 23 - 28

## CLEAR WORKSPACE

```{r, echo = TRUE}
rm(list=ls())
```

## LOAD PACKAGES

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## READ IN DATA

```{r, echo = TRUE}
Table.2.1 <- read_csv(file = "Table.2.1.csv")
```

## CLEAN DATA

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Create a tibble (coerce the data into tidyverse data frame)

as_tibble(Table.2.1)
```

## Make column "Gender" into factors and label it

```{r, echo = TRUE}
Table.2.1 = Table.2.1 %>% 
  mutate(Gender = factor(Gender, levels=c("1", "2"),
                         labels=c("male", "female")))
```

## Nominal Scale

From page 27 of Thorndike: "One way to define measurement is *the assignment of numbers to objects according to a set of rules*. The set of rules is called a scale. Knowing the scale that has been used to assigned the numbers is critical to proper interpretation of the measurement. For example, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Cordero assigned the number 1 to their male students and the number 2 to their female students."

"When numbers are used in this way, the scale is called a **nominal scale**.

## Make column "Class" into factors and label

In the same way, which classroom students are in is also going to be labeled with a nominal scale that we will change into a factor.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
Table.2.1 = Table.2.1 %>% 
  mutate(Class = factor(Class, levels=c("1", "2"),
          labels=c("Johnson", "Cordero")))
```

## Coerce scores to be integers

This is optional, but I wanted to make this explicit. Sometimes cutting and pasting Excel numbers can cause the data to get funky.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
Table.2.1 <- Table.2.1 %>% 
  mutate(Reading = as.integer(Reading), 
         Spelling = as.integer(Spelling),
         Math = as.integer(Math))
```

## Look at the structure of the data

```{r, echo = TRUE}
str(Table.2.1)
```

## display summary on your console

```{r, echo = TRUE}
summary(Table.2.1)
```

## Write csv file of cleaned up Thorndike table

```{r, echo = TRUE}
write_csv(Table.2.1, "Table.2.1_clean.csv")
```
